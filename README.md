# NaviChoice

An iOS Safari extension that redirects Google Map Links to your choice of Apple Maps or Waze

## The Project
I like Apple Maps and have always been so frustrated when I want to navigate to a location found on Google Search. This fixes that problem. I also threw in optional functionality that removes Google Search ads that populate the first couple results in your Google searches.

## Contributing
Please feel free to email or open any Github issues for ideas or bugs

From https://opensource.guide/legal/#are-public-github-projects-open-source:
> Public projects are covered by GitHub’s Terms of Service, which allows others to view and fork your project, but your work otherwise comes with no permissions.
> If you want others to use, distribute, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it’s public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so.
